Approach:
1.	Create the Calculator structure using an HTML input tag for date input and submit button.
2.	Style the structure with CSS using classes and elements.
3.	In JavaScript, get the current date using the built-in new Date() method and convert the input data into usable formats.
4.	If the current date is less than that of the birth date, then that month is not counted, and for subtracting dates we add a number of month days to the current date so as to get the difference in the dates.
5.	If the current month is less than the birth month, then the current year is not taken into count as this year has not been completed and for getting the difference of months, we subtract by adding 12 to the current month.
6.	In the end, we just need to subtract the days, months, and years to get the difference after the two conditions are dealt with.
7.	Calculate the age difference in the inputs dates and show the calculated output.

Languages Used:
